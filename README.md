## Book Recommendation System

This project consists of 3 parts:
- ML model 
- Web App
- Heroku Deployment

- The purpose of this Web App is to recommend books to users based on its similarities (wikipedia page) to the query book.
- The steps required consists of:

-- Used NLTK library to vectorize the book titles.
-- Used Word embedding in order to group similar vectors in the vector space.
-- Used Recurrent neural network to train the model 
-- Used Flask for the backend of the web app
-- Used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend 
-- Used Heroku to deploy the web app 


PYTHON LIBRARIES USED:

- pandas
- numpy
- SKlearn
- FLask
- Math
- Matplotlib


THINGS TO IMPROVE IN THE FUTURE

- The book title needs to be typed out completely. For example, the book "fungus and boogeman" can only be found by typing out completely
and not by just typing "fungus" or "boogeman". This can be solved in the future by letting users type out a keyword in order to find the books.
